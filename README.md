# Advent of Code 2022

Advent of code is an [advent calender](https://adventofcode.com) of short programming puzzles developed by Eric Wastl.

My personal goal is to solve every puzzle in either R or Python 3.

To apply the scripts to your own datasets:
1. clone the repository
2. download your user-specific dataset
3. run either one of the following:
   * `python3 python_solutions/day*.py -in data.txt`
   * `Rscript R_solutions/day*.R -in data.txt`
