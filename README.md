# Advent of Code 2022

Advent of code is an [advent calender](https://adventofcode.com) of short programming puzzles developed by Eric Wastl.

My personal goal is to solve every puzzle in both R and Python 3.

To apply the scripts to your own datasets:
1. clone the repository
2. navigate into the directory of the day in question
3. move your own dataset into the same directory and name it "data.txt" 
4. run either one of the following:
   * `python3 day*.py`
   * `Rscript day*.R`
